# Amazon SNS and AWS X\-Ray<a name="xray-services-sns"></a>

You can use AWS X\-Ray with Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) to trace and analyze requests as they travel through your SNS topics to your [SNS\-supported subscription services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-active-tracing.html)\. Use X\-Ray tracing with Amazon SNS to analyze latencies in your messages and their back\-end services, such as how long a request spends in a topic, and how long it takes to deliver the message to each of the topic’s subscriptions\. 

If you publish to an Amazon SNS topic from a service that’s already instrumented with X\-Ray, Amazon SNS passes the trace context from publisher to subscribers\. In addition, you can turn on active tracing to send segment data about your Amazon SNS subscriptions to X\-Ray for messages published from an instrumented SNS client\. [Turn on active tracing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-active-tracing.html) for an Amazon SNS topic by using the Amazon SNS console, or by using the Amazon SNS API or CLI\. See [Instrumenting your application](xray-instrumenting-your-app.md) for more information about instrumenting your SNS clients\. 

## Configure Amazon SNS active tracing<a name="xray-services-sns-configuration"></a>

You can use the Amazon SNS console or the AWS CLI or SDK to configure Amazon SNS active tracing\. 

When you use the Amazon SNS console, Amazon SNS attempts to create the necessary permissions for SNS to call X\-Ray\. The attempt can be rejected if you don't have sufficient permissions to modify X\-Ray resource policies\. For more information about these permissions, see [Identity and access management in Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html) and [Example cases for Amazon SNS access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-access-policy-use-cases.html) in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide\. For more information about turning on active tracing using the Amazon SNS console, see [Enabling active tracing on an Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-active-tracing.html) in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide\. 

When using the AWS CLI or SDK to turn on active tracing, you must manually configure the permissions using resource\-based policies\. Use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_PutResourcePolicy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_PutResourcePolicy.html) to configure X\-Ray with the necessary resource\-based policy to allow Amazon SNS to send traces to X\-Ray\. 

**Example X\-Ray resource\-based policy for Amazon SNS active tracing**  
This example policy document specifies the permissions that Amazon SNS needs to send trace data to X\-Ray:  

```
{
    Version: "2012-10-17",
    Statement: [
      {
        Sid: "SNSAccess",
        Effect: Allow,
        Principal: {
          Service: "sns.amazonaws.com",
        },
        Action: [
          "xray:PutTraceSegments",
          "xray:GetSamplingRules",
          "xray:GetSamplingTargets"
        ],
        Resource: "*",
        Condition: {
          StringEquals: {
            "aws:SourceAccount": "account-id"
          },
          StringLike: {
            "aws:SourceArn": "arn:partition:sns:region:account-id:topic-name"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```
Use the CLI to create a resource\-based policy that gives Amazon SNS permissions to send trace data to X\-Ray:   

```
aws xray put-resource-policy --policy-name MyResourcePolicy --policy-document '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "SNSAccess", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": "sns.amazonaws.com" }, "Action": [ "xray:PutTraceSegments", "xray:GetSamplingRules", "xray:GetSamplingTargets" ], "Resource": "*", "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "aws:SourceAccount": "my-account-id" }, "StringLike": { "aws:SourceArn": "arn:my-partition:sns:my-region:my-account-id:my-topic-name" } } } ] }'
```
To use these examples, replace *`partition`*, *`region`*, *`account-id`*, and *`topic-name`* with your specific AWS partition, region, account ID, and Amazon SNS topic name\. To give all Amazon SNS topics permission to send trace data to X\-Ray, replace the topic name with `*`\. 

## View Amazon SNS publisher and subscriber traces in the X\-Ray console<a name="xray-services-sns-view-traces"></a>

Use the X\-Ray console to view a service map, trace map, and trace details that display a connected view of Amazon SNS publishers and subscribers\. When Amazon SNS active tracing is turned on for a topic, the X\-Ray service map and trace map displays connected nodes for Amazon SNS publishers, the Amazon SNS topic, and downstream subscribers: 

![\[Service map with Amazon SNS publisher and subscriber\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/images/services-sns-activetracing-map.png)

After choosing a trace that spans an Amazon SNS publisher and subscriber, the X\-Ray trace details page displays a trace map and segment timeline\. 

**Example timeline with Amazon SNS publisher and subscriber**  
This example shows a timeline that includes an Amazon SNS publisher that sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic, which is processed by an Amazon SQS subscriber\.   

![\[Segment timeline for Amazon SNS publisher and subscriber\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/images/services-sns-activetracing-timeline.png)

The example timeline above provides details about the Amazon SNS message flow: 
+ The **SNS** segment represents the round\-trip duration of the `Publish` API call from the client\.
+ The **myTopic** segment represents the latency of the Amazon SNS response to the publish request\.
+ The **SQS** subsegment represents the round\-trip time it takes Amazon SNS to publish the message to an Amazon SQS queue\.
+ The time between the **myTopic** segment and the **SQS** subsegment represents the time that the message spends in the Amazon SNS system\.

**Example timeline with batched Amazon SNS messages**  
If multiple Amazon SNS messages are batched within a single trace, the segment timeline displays segments that represent each message that's processed\.
